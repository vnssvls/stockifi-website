## CMS vs static summary
- **CMS (Strapi-driven):** Integrations listing, Blog (listing + posts), Customer Stories (listing + posts). Testimonials feed the homepage/calculator sliders (no own pages).
- **Static (Astro):** Home, 4 Product pages, all Solutions pages, Savings Calculator, Pricing, About/Contact, Comparisons, Legal, the two Intro LP pages.
- **UI strings** (nav, footer, buttons, forms) → i18n dictionary files, not Strapi.

---

## URL + redirect notes
- **Preserve all existing slugs** (blog posts, customer stories, /integrations, /savings-calculator, /contact, legal, /intro) — these already rank, so keep them and avoid redirects.
- **New pages** (Product, Solutions, Pricing, About, Comparisons) have no old equivalent — no redirect needed, just submit to sitemap.
- **Redirects only where something changes:** confirm `skigeilo` vs `skigeilo-2` (one may 301 to the other). Full old→new audit happens in Workstream B (SEO) against the 332-URL sitemap, but the 1:1 slug preservation keeps it small.
- Canonical: pick www vs non-www and trailing-slash policy once, apply site-wide.

## Decisions — LOCKED (2026-05-30)
1. By-role pages: **Owners & GMs · Finance · Head Chefs · Operations**.
2. Careers: **dropped** (not in v1).
3. Supplier Price Tracking page slug: **`/product/supplier-price-tracking`** (primary keyword "supplier price tracking"; invoice automation secondary — more winnable than the saturated "invoice processing" term).
4. Canonical: **`www.stockifi.io`, no trailing slash**, applied site-wide (matches current domain, avoids redirect churn).

Pending sign-off: V final glance + Simon (esp. comparison-page scope).
